# CPU_Scheduling_Algorithm
Operating System Project:

 In this project we implement these CPU scheduling algorithm in `python`.
  Our purpose is to show which CPU scheduling algorithm is worked efficiently.
  
  
  Steps of project:
  
    * Read from test.csv which is conclude information about process.
    * Get context switch time and time quantum from user
    * Implement each algorithm(FSFS,SJF,SRT,RR)
    * Show gantt_chart and I/O time
    * Calculate average of turnaround time , waiting time ,response time , cpu utilization , throughput
    * Save result 
    * DONE!
